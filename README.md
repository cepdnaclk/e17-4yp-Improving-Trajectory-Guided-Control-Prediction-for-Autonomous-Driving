# Improving Trajectory Guided Control Prediction for Autonomous Driving

___


Current end-to-end autonomous driving methods either run a controller based ona planned trajectory or perform control prediction directly. Trajectory Guided Control Prediction for Autonomous Driving (TCP) combines these two methods and fuse the outputs of the two branches to achieve the complementary advantages. 

In this project we first are trying to identify the issues in the TCP architecture and to improve its accuracy. [Carla Simulator](https://carla.org/) will be used to test the accuracy of our models.
